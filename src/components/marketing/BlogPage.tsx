        <Lead>Customer loyalty is broken. It has become a choice between two bad options: paper cards that get lost in the wash, or clunky apps customers refuse to download.</Lead>
        <P>Look inside your wallet right now. Odds are there&rsquo;s a half-stamped paper card from a shop you visited three months ago. Maybe five of them. Now look at your phone — how many times has a cashier asked you to &ldquo;download our app&rdquo; just to earn a point, while your order went cold?</P>
        <P>Independent merchants desperately need a way to build loyalty and keep customers. But forcing a customer to jump through hoops is the fastest way to lose them. So we asked: what if loyalty required zero friction? Join, get a stamp, and save your progress in under five seconds — without ever opening the App Store.</P>
        <H2>You finally get customer data</H2>
        <P>When you hand out a paper card, the customer walks out a ghost. You don&rsquo;t know their name, how often they visit, or what they buy. Stampfix captures that from the first stamp, so you can see your best regulars and run promotions that land.</P>
        <H2>Zero friction means higher sign-ups</H2>
        <P>Ask 100 people to download an app and maybe 5 will. Ask them to scan a QR code and almost all of them will. Because Stampfix is a web tool, onboarding is instant — and more participation means a program that actually works.</P>
        <H2>The secret weapon: Apple &amp; Google Wallet</H2>
        <P>Once a customer scans your code, they get one button: Add to Apple Wallet or Google Wallet. This is where a cool web tool becomes a retention strategy:</P>
        <UL items={[
          <><strong>No downloads.</strong> Wallet is already on their phone for their bank cards and boarding passes.</>,
          <><strong>Always front and center.</strong> Your card sits next to their Apple Pay — impossible to lose.</>,
          <><strong>Location reminders.</strong> A gentle nudge on the lock screen when they&rsquo;re near your shop.</>,
          <><strong>Dynamic updates.</strong> A new stamp updates the card in real time.</>,
        ]} />
        <H2>It&rsquo;s time to ditch the paper</H2>
        <P>Loyalty is about making customers feel valued, not giving them homework. Skip the App Store, retire the punch card, and step into the future of retention.</P>

        <Lead>Paper punch cards feel free. They aren&rsquo;t — they just hide the bill across three line items you never total up.</Lead>
        <H2>1. Printing you reorder forever</H2>
        <P>Cards get handed out, tossed, and lost, so you reprint — hundreds at a time, again and again. It&rsquo;s a small recurring cost that never ends because the medium itself is disposable.</P>
        <H2>2. The &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; customer</H2>
        <P>Every paper card walks out the door anonymous. You can&rsquo;t see who&rsquo;s close to a reward, who&rsquo;s slipping away, or who your best regulars are — so you can&rsquo;t act. The lost revenue from customers you could have won back is invisible, which is exactly why it hurts.</P>
        <H2>3. Fraud you can&rsquo;t see</H2>
        <P>Custom hole-punchers are for sale online. A paper grid can&rsquo;t tell a real visit from a faked one, so some of the rewards you give away were never earned.</P>
        <H2>The digital alternative</H2>
        <P>A wallet-native card removes all three: nothing to reprint, every visit attached to a name in your dashboard, and stamps that are signed and server-verified so they can&rsquo;t be faked. The same loyalty loop — without the leaks.</P>

        <Lead>The install is the tax. Every screen between &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like a loyalty card&rdquo; and &ldquo;I have one&rdquo; is where customers quietly give up.</Lead>
        <P>People guard their home screens. Asking someone to visit the App Store, wait for a download, create an account, and grant permissions — just to earn a point on a sandwich — is a lot to ask at a register with a line behind them.</P>
        <H2>The math of friction</H2>
        <P>Roughly 5 in 100 people will download an app at the counter. Around 95 in 100 will scan a QR code with the camera already in their hand. Same customers, wildly different outcome — and it comes down entirely to how many steps stand in the way.</P>

        <Lead>You don&rsquo;t have to choose between &ldquo;expensive app&rdquo; and &ldquo;paper.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a third option most small businesses miss.</Lead>
        <H2>What a wallet pass actually is</H2>
        <P>Apple Wallet and Google Wallet already hold your customers&rsquo; boarding passes and bank cards. A loyalty pass is the same kind of object: a card that lives in an app they already trust and open. Adding one takes a single tap — no download, no account setup.</P>

        <UL items={[
          <><strong>Adoption.</strong> A tap versus an install is the whole ballgame.</>,
          <><strong>Cost.</strong> No six-figure development, no two app stores to maintain.</>,

          <><strong>Reminders.</strong> Location nudges bring people back without you lifting a finger.</>,

        <H2>Where a native app still makes sense</H2>
        <P>If you&rsquo;re a national chain building mobile ordering, delivery, and a rewards marketplace, an app earns its keep. For a café, salon, or food truck who just wants regulars to come back, a wallet pass gives you the part that matters — at a fraction of the cost.</P>
